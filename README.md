# FinalsDataScience

This repository was created as part of the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras Campus Introduction to Data Science Course (CCOM 3031) on December 2020. You will find the necessary data, scripts, and additional information to conduct the same study we performed. The goal was to visually model the statistics for feminicides in Puerto Rico from 2014 to 2018.
